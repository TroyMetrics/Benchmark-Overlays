</p>

This fully dynamic layout automatically adjusts for 4 to 24-core CPUs, detecting and displaying only physical cores in properly ordered CPU bar charts. On Intel systems, Performance (P) cores are shown first, followed by Efficiency (E) cores. On AMD, cores are displayed in logical, physical order — providing an accurate and readable view of real CPU utilization during gameplay or stress testing.

## 🧠 System Monitoring
Includes 1% lows, average, and current FPS metrics, GPU and CPU temperatures, clock speeds, average effective clock speeds, utilization, VRAM usage, system RAM usage, latency metrics and more.

## 🕹️ Latency Module (Render | Sim-to-Render Latency)
Added below the Frame Time Graph, now showing **Render Latency** and **Sim-to-Render Latency** in milliseconds.
- Dynamic values are centered for cleaner aesthetics given the layout while the titles (LAT and MS) remain static for less distraction. 
- Metrics are capped at **999 ms** to prevent huge number strings from shooting across the screen during certain scenarios (e.g. when Alt-Tabbing in and out of a game).

</p>

Designed for **GPUs equipped with 12VHPWR per-pin telemetry**, such as the **ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090**, this module provides real-time electrical insight directly within the overlay.  

- Displays **individual 12VHPWR pin amperage** in real time.  
- Calculates and displays **total current draw** and **pin balance percentage**.  
- Uses adaptive color indicators to show **normal, warning, and danger** states.  
- Alerts the user to unsafe conditions such as  
  ‣ **Excessive current** (≥ 9.2 A per pin)  
  ‣ **Dropped pins** (≈ 0 A)  
  ‣ **Imbalance** across 12 V rails.  
- Enables **early detection** of potential cable or connector faults before failure occurs.

# ⚡️ Power Detector Features & Warnings

The Power Detector module is designed for GPUs with 12VHPWR per-pin sensors (such as the ASUS ROG Astral RTX 5090). The Power Detector monitors individual pin amperage, calculating total current, pin balance percentage, and visualizing per-pin status. It dynamically alerts users to unsafe conditions like excessive current (≥9.2 A), dropped pins (≈0 A), and imbalance across power rails—enabling early detection of potential cable or connector issues.

<!-- Power Detector Warnings -->

## <img src="https://github.com/TroyMetrics/Benchmark-Overlays/blob/main/assets/images/Power_Status_Normal.png" width="20"> **Normal State ✅** <br>
This icon indicates that all 12VHPWR pins are operating within expected parameters — with amperage levels safely below the maximum rated specification and well-balanced across all pins. No action is required. ✅<br><br>

## <img src="https://github.com/TroyMetrics/Benchmark-Overlays/blob/main/assets/images/Power_Status_Warning.png" width="20"> **Warning State (Power Imbalance) ⚠️** <br>
This icon and alert activates when a significant current disparity is detected between pins (**≤85% power balance**) which may result in hazardous operating conditions under sustained or peak GPU load. The included chart provides a clear visual breakdown of each pin's current deviation from the target or **ideal** per-pin load, calculated dynamically based on total power draw. ⚠️<br>

## <img src="https://github.com/TroyMetrics/Benchmark-Overlays/blob/main/assets/images/Power_Status_NA.png" width="20"> **Sensors Not Available ➖** <br>

This notice is shown when **per-pin amperage telemetry is unavailable**, either because the **user’s GPU does not support individual 12VHPWR pin sensors**, or because **HWiNFO64 is not running or not reporting sensor data**. In this state, the Power Detector is unable to monitor power integrity or detect pin-specific anomalies.

# 🛠️ Setup & Installation

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before setting up the TroyMetrics Benchmark Overlay, make sure the following software is installed and properly configured:

**✅ MSI Afterburner + RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS)**

🔽 Download the latest BETA versions of **MSI Afterburner & RTSS** from [www.guru3d.com](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/msi-afterburner-beta-download.html)
> 📝 Note: The latest beta builds are often shared exclusively on the official Guru3D forums by the developer, Unwinder.
- The MSI Afterburner installer comes bundled with **RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS)** — this is required for the overlay to function.
- During installation, ensure that **✅ RTSS** is **check-marked.**

---

**✅ HWiNFO64**

🔽 Download the latest version of **HWiNFO64** from [www.hwinfo.com](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/)
> **🛡️ Recommended for Power Users:** Consider purchasing the paid version to remove the **12-hour Shared Memory Support time limit** and **enable automatic updates.**

**⚙️ Important Configuration Steps:**
1. Launch HWiNFO64 (Sensors Only) and click the **`[Sensors]`** button
2. Click the Cogwheel button in the bottom-right ⚙️ **`"Configure Sensors"`**
3. In the new window, click **`[Main Settings]`** (bottom-right)
4. Make sure **`✔ Shared Memory Support`** is enabled

> ✅ Shared Memory Support is required for RTSS to read sensor data from HWiNFO — especially critical for modules like the **12VHPWR Power Detector** (per-pin amperage monitoring).

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

> ⚠️ **Important:** RTSS must remain installed on the **C:\\ drive**. Installing it elsewhere (e.g. D:\\) can cause missing or broken overlay icons due to location-dependent resources. See [Issue #7](https://github.com/TroyMetrics/Benchmark-Overlays/issues/7) for details and a potential work around.

**1. 📦 Extract and Prepare Files**
- Open the downloaded package: **`TroyMetrics Benchmark Overlays`**
- In a **new File Explorer window**, navigate to your **`C:\` drive**

**2. 📁 Copy Overlay Files to RTSS**
- **Drag and drop** (or **copy/paste**) the folder named **`Program Files (x86)`** from the downloaded package directly into your **`C:\` drive**
- If prompted for admin permission:
  - ✅ Check **"Do this for all current items"**
  - ✅ Click **"Continue"**

> This step places the overlay files in the correct RTSS directory.

## 🌈 **(Optional) Setup – Rainbow Speed Sensor**

Since **v1.10**, the overlay package introduces a new preset — **TM Benchmark Overlay – Rainbow** — featuring a smooth full-spectrum color-shifting animation across all elements.  

This section explains how to adjust the **rainbow animation speed** using a simple formula in RTSS.

![Rainbow GPU Preview](https://github.com/TroyMetrics/Benchmark-Overlays/blob/main/assets/images/Rainbow_GPU_Preview.gif)

**✨ Overview**
* The animation speed is driven by the **data source sensor `R1`**.  
* By default, `R1` is configured as a **30-second color loop**, using this formula:

  ```
  (x%30000)/300
  ```

**⚙️ Adjusting the Speed**
If you’d like to make the rainbow cycle faster or slower, simply modify the loop duration in the formula.  
To maintain the full color range without breaking the spectrum cycle, follow this pattern:

| Desired Loop Duration | Formula |
|------------------------|----------|
| 60 seconds | `(x%60000)/600` |
| 30 seconds *(default)* | `(x%30000)/300` |
| 20 seconds | `(x%20000)/200` |
| 10 seconds | `(x%10000)/100` |
| 5 seconds | `(x%5000)/50` |

You can experiment with other values as long as the **division remains consistent** with the total loop time.

>⚠️ Note: To the best of my knowledge, a true animated rainbow gradient effect is not currently possible in RTSS unless used as a static image. This preset is a **color-shifting animation**, not a gradient hack.

**🧭 Example Setup**
Below is an example of the **Rainbow Speed Sensor** configured in RTSS OverlayEditor:
