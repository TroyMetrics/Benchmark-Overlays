# Benchmark-Overlay
RTSS / RivaTuner Overlay

A clean and professional RTSS overlay built for high-visibility performance benchmarking. This fully dynamic overlay balances vital metrics with visual clarity and adapts to any Intel or AMD CPU (up to 24 cores), ensuring correct core ordering for accurate real-time hardware insight during gameplay or stress tests.

Includes 3 versions: a 2-Fan GPU design, 3-Fan GPU design, and a dedicated Power Detector module designed for GPUs with 12VHPWR per-pin sensors (such as the ASUS ROG Astral RTX 5090). The Power Detector intelligently monitors individual pin amperage, calculating total current, pin balance percentage, and visualizing per-pin status. It dynamically alerts users to unsafe conditions like excessive current (≥9.2 A), dropped pins (≈0 A), and imbalance across power rails—enabling early detection of potential cable or connector issues.
