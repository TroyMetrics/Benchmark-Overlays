The Power Detector module is designed for GPUs with 12VHPWR (12V 6+2) per-pin sensors (such as the ASUS ROG Astral RTX 5090). The Power Detector monitors individual pin amperage, calculating total current, pin balance percentage, and visualizing per-pin status. It dynamically alerts users to unsafe conditions like excessive current (â‰¥9.2 A), dropped pins (â‰ˆ0 A), and imbalance across power railsâ€”enabling early detection of potential cable or connector issues.
